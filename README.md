Some things I learned during this project were how to interpret user needs and implement them into the final product. By closely studying the user stories that are created based on market research and focus groups, I can create an experience that not only appeals to the average user, but also fulfills their needs within the application. When developing these applications, it's important for me to understand not just the user's needs, but how they will interact with the finished application. Creating an intuitive and easily navigable user interface is just as important and developing loosely couple code.

All of these tasks are important, and the bigger the project the bigger the team needs to be. Working with a team means constant open communication. Being able to provide not only constructive criticisms, but also solutions to problems is of great importance. Being supportive of your team keeps things running smoothly, and maintains a positive work environment where everyone feels valued and no one is made to feel inadequate or less useful. Good team members work closely with one another and value each other's opinions. After all, it will take the whole team working together to create a complex and polished final application.
